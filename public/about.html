<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Michael Hellon. No matter where I have traveled, I have always considered Kansas to be home, Colorado is a 
  very close second though. I have a BBA in Finance. I have two children, a daughter (19), and a son (18). My wife and I
  have 3 cats: Gracie, Howie, Carrot. Gracie thinks she the queen, Howie thinks he a panther, and Carrot is a little 
  ginger that likes her own space. Some of my hobbies include reading, home brewing and wine making, woodworking, 
  hiking, rock climbing, and model rocketry. </p>

<p>After I retire, I plan on pursuing a job as a Full-Stack Software Engineer working remotely so I can stay in Kansas where 
  my house, my family and friends are. I started learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS about 8 months ago. I plan on learning 
  Python, C++, C# and the many support programs and everything that I need to be successful in my new career. I enjoy the 
  coding side of this. I enjoy writing code and building programs to do things.</p>
