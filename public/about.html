<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I am Michael Hellon. No matter where I have traveled, I have always considered Kansas to be home, Colorado is a 
  very close second though. I went to school in Kansas and even attended college at Wichita State University in Wichita, 
  Kansas. I have a BBA in Finance. I have two children, a daughter, and a son. Lorelai age 19, and Bishop age 18. My wife, 
  Jaime and I have 3 cats: Gracie, Howie, Carrot. Gracie thinks she the queen, Howie thinks he a panther, and Carrot is a 
  little ginger that likes her own space. Some of my hobbies include reading, home brewing and wine making, woodworking, 
  hiking, rock climbing, and model rocketry. </p>

<p>On June 30, 2024, I will be retiring from the US Army after 20 years of faithful service. During that time, I had 3 
  combat deployments, two to Iraq and once to Afghanistan. I also had 2 rotations, one to Kuwait and another to Europe. 
  I consider myself lucky that I only had to pack up everything and move bases three times. I have some friends that seem 
  to move every 3 years. Of those 20 years, I have spent all but the last two years in a heavy armor unit, and now 
  currently in an Aviation unit.  During my time, I have attended many classes and earned many certificates related to my 
  duty positions. Of all of them, I have had the privilege to attend and graduated from the US Army Air Assault School and 
  Pathfinder school, two of the hardest courses the US Army offers.  I had an opportunity to attend both Ranger School and 
  Airbourne School but turned them done after injuring my back in Afghanistan. While in the Army some of the duty positions, 
  I have held are; Platoon Sergeant, Support Operations NCOIC, Company Battle NCOIC, Base Defense NCOIC, Sling load NCOIC, 
  and Helicopter Landing Zone NCOIC, and as an Army Instructor for the Basic Leaders Course at Ft Liberty, NC. I am happy 
  to be retiring in Kansas. Kansas has always been home, with Colorado a very close second.</p>

<p>After I retire, I plan on pursuing a job as a Full-Stack Software Engineer working remotely so I can stay in Kansas where 
  my house, my family and friends are. I started learning JavaScript, HTML and CSS about 8 months ago. I plan on learning 
  Python, C++, C# and the many support programs and everything that I need to be successful in my new career. I enjoy the 
  coding side of this. I enjoy writing code and building programs to do things. Some of the programs I have written so far 
  include a digital version of the Magic 8-ball; and a rock, paper, scissors game. I want to put down some actual roots in 
  Kansas and stay in one spot for more than 5 to 6 years. I am so very tired of packing everything up and moving across the 
  country.  I missed most of my childrenâ€™s lives due to the deployments and the training requirements of the Army. I look 
  forward to spending as much time with them as I can. I look forward to being able to take vacations and trips where I 
  want to go I look forward to pursuing my hobbies now that I should have my nights and weekends free from having to go to 
  the field or deployments.</p>
